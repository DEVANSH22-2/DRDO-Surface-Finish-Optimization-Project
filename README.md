# DRDO-Surface-Finish-Optimization-Project
Optimization of CNC Milling Parameters using Taguchi Method
This repository contains the detailed project report for my summer internship at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Dehradun.

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on the practical application of statistical methods to solve a real-world manufacturing challenge: optimizing the surface finish of components machined from AL6061 aluminum alloy. A high-quality surface finish is critical for the performance and longevity of parts used in the defense and aerospace sectors.

The primary objective was to identify the optimal combination of CNC milling parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut) to achieve the minimum possible surface roughness (Ra).

**Methodology & Tools**

Statistical Method: The Taguchi Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology was employed using an L9 orthogonal array to ensure an efficient and robust experimental design.

Execution: Hands-on experiments were conducted on a BFW BMV 35+ CNC machine.

Analysis: Surface roughness was measured with a Bruker Contour GT non-contact profilometer, and the results were analyzed using Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratios.

Software: Siemens NX9 was used for related CAD/CAM tasks.

**Key Findings**

The optimal parameter combination for minimizing surface roughness was determined to be:

Speed: 6000 rpm
Feed: 240 mm/min
Depth of Cut: 0.2 mm

The analysis concluded that feed rate was the most significant factor influencing the final surface quality.
